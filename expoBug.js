This error typically occurs when using the Expo CLI to manage projects that involve multiple devices or emulators. It manifests as an inability to successfully start or connect to the development server, often accompanied by cryptic messages or exceptions related to network connections or port conflicts. The root cause frequently involves misconfigurations in the Expo project settings or conflicts with other applications running on the same machine.  For instance, if another application is already using the port designated by Expo, the development server will fail to start, producing an error about the port being in use.
