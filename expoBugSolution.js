The solution focuses on checking for port conflicts and adjusting the Expo project configuration.  If an error indicates a port is in use, identify the conflicting process (using tools like `netstat` or `lsof`) and either terminate it or change the Expo port.  

Here's how you would change the port in `app.json` or `expo.json`:
```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "My App",
    "slug": "my-app",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "android": {
      "package": "com.myapp"
    },
    "ios": {
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.myapp"
    },
    "web": {
      "config": {
        "port": 19000 //Changed Port
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then, restart the Expo development server using `expo start`.  If the issue persists after correcting the port in the config file, manually specifying a different port via the command line may be required (e.g., `expo start --port 19001`). This approach ensures that the app runs on an available port.
